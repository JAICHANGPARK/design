## Summary

Provide an standard way to configure QoS settings of different entities in the ROS graph at startup time, overriding the settings specified in code.

## Motivation

Up to ROS 2 Foxy, there's no standard mechanism to reconfigure QoS settings at startup.
It's quite common in the ROS 2 community to reuse nodes that other people have written and in a lot of use cases allowing QoS profiles to be changed make sense.

Up to now, different workarounds have been used in order to provide this reconfigurability:

- Command line arguments.
- ROS parameters to set particular policies.
- Combining parameters, the system default QoS profile, and vendor specific QoS profiles.

Here are some examples applying these mechanisms:

- rosbag2 has an ad-hoc mechanism to override QoS profiles when recording or doing playback ([docs](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Ros2bag/Overriding-QoS-Policies-For-Recording-And-Playback/)).
- Image pipeline nodes use some parameters to allow changing some of the policies ([PR](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/521)).
- Ouster drivers also use some parameters to allow changing some policies ([PR](https://github.com/ros-drivers/ros2_ouster_drivers/pull/26)).
- Gazebo ROS packages allows configuring QoS profiles of the plugins in the SDF file ([issue](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1079)).

Not providing an standard mechanism for reconfiguring QoS results in a lot of slightly different interfaces to do the same thing, creating a pain point for end users when figuring out how to reconfigure QoS for nodes in their system.

## Design goals

This proposal was written with the following requirements in mind:

- Shall be opt-in on a per entity basis.
  - Rationale: Allowing to change all QoS policies could break a contract the node's implementer assumed.
  For example, the node's implementer may have assumed that the data was durable and not volatile.
  Allowing the node's author to only accept some reconfigurations will avoid user errors.
- Shall allow the developer to accept/reject changes to a QoS profile with a validation callback.
  - See rationale above.
- Shall only apply to publisher/subscriber QoS.
  - Rationale: Though you can currently pass a custom QoS profiles to services or actions, configuring them is quite fragile and some of the policies cannot be modified (e.g. best effort services don't work).
  Until a better QoS profile for services and actions is designed, this feature won't be exposed.
- Shall only allow changing QoS at startup time, and not during runtime by default.
  - Rationale: Allowing runtime reconfiguration of QoS is a complex topic, and purposefully left out of scope in this proposal.
- Shall have a way of reusing the same QoS profile.
  - Rationale: Not having a way of setting the same QoS profile to different entities will make configuring entities which profiles must match (or be compatible) error prone.

## Adding a new mechanism vs using parameters

A previous proposal (see PR [#296](https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/296)) suggested using a new file format for reconfiguring QoS policies.
Some concerns were raised by the community:
1. It adds a different mechanism to the ones that already exist.
    Newcomers have to learn yet another thing.
1. QoS settings are not conceptually different to other parameters, e.g.: publishing rate.
1. It adds a new mechanism to configure QoS profiles.

Based on that feedback, this PR will explore a design based on parameters.

## Introduction

Current code will not allow QoS reconfigurability if not changed:

```cpp
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast{10});
```

To make reconfigurability easy, only a flag is needed to automatically create the parameters:

```cpp
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast{10},
  QosOverridingOptions{true});  // allow_reconfigurable all qos
```

That will automatically declare the parameters for reconfiguring the QoS policies that can be overridden in the following way:

```yaml
/my/ns/node_name:
  ros__parameters:
    qos_profiles:  # group for all the qos settings
      publisher:
        'my/fully/qualified/topic/name/here': 
          reliability: reliable
          history_depth: 100
          history: keep_last
```

A callback to accept/reject the configured profile can also be specified:

```cpp
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast(10),
  [] (const QoSProfile & qos) -> bool {
      return qos.is_reliable();  // only accept reliable communication, we should add getters to rclcpp::QoSProfile class for this.
  });
```

The user provided QoS callback will be internally used as a [parameters callback](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/3a4ac0ca2093d12035070443692798b0c9f9da3a/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/node_interfaces/node_parameters_interface.hpp#L183), but we provide a more user-friendly interface.

## Analysis of parameter API features and limitations

### Read-only parameters

ROS 2 currently provides read only parameters.
They can be modified at startup time by providing an override (e.g. `--ros-args -p <param_name> <param_value>`), but they cannot be dynamically changed later.

This perfectly matches the goal of the proposal of not making qos settings reconfigurable.

### Parameter events

Up to ROS 2 Foxy, read-only parameters generate a parameter event with its initial value when declared.
If we start declaring parameters for each QoS policies of many entities, the amount of parameter events at startup time will be highly increased.

To avoid this issue, a way to opt-out parameter events for a given parameter could be added (should that be the default for read-only parameters??).

### Parameter callbacks

If we want the following example to work:

```cpp
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast(10),
  [] (const QoSProfile & qos) -> bool{
      return qos.is_reliable();
  });
```

We could completely ignore parameters [on set callbacks](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/3defa8fc9d7410bd833ecd95b305ac94bb9b627a/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/node_interfaces/node_parameters_interface.hpp#L180-L192), the publisher creation code would do something like:

```cpp
rcl_interfaces::msg::ParameterDescription policy_x_description{};
policy_x_description.read_only = true;
policy_x_description.description = "<string with a description of the policy, including node and topic name>";
auto policy_x_value = node->declare_parameter(
    "<name of the parameter>", qos_provided_in_code.<getter_for_policy_x>(), policy_x_description);
// Repeat for all policies
rclcpp::QoS final_qos();
// construct `final_qos` from the parameter values read above
if (!user_provided_callback(final_qos) {
    // qos profile rejected, throw error here
}
```

In that way, we avoid installing a parameter callback that will be triggered when any parameter is modified.

Note: this seems to be what you generally want in the case of read-only parameters.
Note 2: We could also have a `declare_parameters_atomically` method and use:
  ```cpp
  auto callback_handle = node->add_on_set_parameters_callback(wrapper_for_qos_callback(user_provided_callback));
  node->declare_parameters_atomically(...);  // names and defaults for all parameters given here
  // callback_handle goes out of scope, the callback is auto-removed.
  ```
  `declare_parameters_atomically` would be needed, if not you cannot have conditions like `history == keep_all or history_depth > 10`.

### Parameters URIs

Parameters URIs currently look like:

```
rosparam://my/full/namespace/node_name/param_group.nested_param_group.param_name
```

For the following qos policy:
- Full node name: `/asd/bsd/my_node`
- Entity: `publisher`
- Topic name: `/foo/bar/topic_name`
- Policy: `reliability`

The URI of the automatically generated parameter would be:

```
rosparam://asd/bsd/my_node/qos_profiles.publisher./foo/bar/topic_name.reliability
```

The `/` in one of the subgroups looks odd, but it's currently accepted.

If in the future the addressing changes described in [#241](https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/241) are implemented, the URI would be:

```
rosparam://asd.bsd.my_node/qos_profiles/publisher/foo/bar/topic_name/reliability
```

but in both cases the previous parameters file example wouldn't change.

## Caveats

### Creating more than one publisher/subscription in the same topic with different QoS

If only the topic name is used for the parameter name, it would be impossible to create two publishers with different QoS in the same topic.

That could be solved by adding an optional extra identifier:

```cpp
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast(10),
  QosOverridingOptions {
    [] (const QoSProfile & qos) -> bool {
        return qos.is_reliable();  // only accept reliable communication
    },
    "id1"
  });
node->create_publisher(
  "chatter",
  KeepLast(10),
  QosOverridingOptions { 
    [] (const QoSProfile & qos) -> bool {
      return !qos.is_reliable();  // only accept best effort communication
    },
    "id2"
  });
```

```yaml
/my/ns/node_name:
  ros__parameters:
    qos_profiles:
      publisher_id1:  # {entity_type}_{id}
        'my/fully/qualified/topic/name/here': 
          reliability: reliable
            history_depth: 100
             history: keep_last
      publisher_id2:  # {entity_type}_{id}
        'my/fully/qualified/topic/name/here': 
          reliability: best_effort
            history_depth: 100
            history: keep_last
```

### Lowering the amount of declared parameters

#### Hidden parameters

Currently, ROS 2 has the concept of hidden topics and services.
Those aren't listed in the cli tool commands, except when the user explicitly asks them to be included.

Similarly, hidden parameters could be added.
That will avoid showing a big list of all policies.

#### Only declaring some parameters

Instead of hidden parameters that correspond to the QoS policies, we could only declare parameters for the policies that the user want to be reconfigurable.
That will lower the amount of declared parameters, but make publisher/subscription creation a bit more verbose.

Example API:

```cpp
enum class QosPolicyKind {
  Reliability,
  ...,
};

/// Options that are passed in subscription/publisher constructor
class QosOverridingOptions
{
    /// Constructor, allowing to declare all the "default" parameters. If `false` is passed, reconfiguring QoS is not allowed.
    explicit QosOverridingOptions(bool declare_default_parameters, std::string id = "");
    /// Implicit constructor, a parameter for each policy provided in the initializer list will be declared.
    QosOverridingOptions(std::initializer_list<QosPolicyKind>, std::string id = "");
    /// Same with a callback for accepting/rejecting the qos profile.
    QosOverridingOptions(std::initializer_list<QosPolicyKind>, QosCallback callback, std::string id = "");
    /// Declares the "default" parameters and pass a callback.
    QosOverridingOptions(QosCallback callback, std::string id = "");
};
```

```cpp
// New method in Node class
template<
typename MessageT,
typename AllocatorT = std::allocator<void>,
typename PublisherT = rclcpp::Publisher<MessageT, AllocatorT>>
std::shared_ptr<PublisherT>
create_publisher(
  const std::string & topic_name,
  const rclcpp::QoS & qos,
  const rclcpp::QosOverridingOptions & qos_options = QosOverridingOptions{false},
  const PublisherOptionsWithAllocator<AllocatorT> & options = PublisherOptionsWithAllocator<AllocatorT>()
);
```

```cpp
// example usage
node->create_publisher(
    "my_topic",
    user_qos_provided_in_code_1,
    rclcpp::KeepLast(10),
    {  // implicit, to lower verbosity
        {QosPolicyKind::Reliability, QosPolicyKind::History, QosPolicyKind::HistoryDepth}, // only declare parameters for history depth, history kind, reliability
        [](const QoSProfile qos) -> bool {
            return qos.is_keep_all() || qos.history_depth() > 10u;  // constrains involving more than one QoS in callbacks
        },
        "my_id",  // id to disambiguate entities in same topic
    });

// nothing is reconfigurable
node->create_publisher(
    "my_topic",
    user_qos_provided_in_code_2,
    rclcpp::KeepLast(10));

// allow reconfiguring durability
node->create_publisher(
    "another_topic",
    user_qos_provided_in_code_3,
    rclcpp::KeepLast(10),
    QosOverridingOptions{QosPolicyKind::Durability});
```

The above API mentions having some "defaults". 
The intend of that is to provide a less verbose option, in which case the user can opt-in qos reconfigurability by only opting-in a flag.

Proposed defaults:
- Reliability
- History kind
- History depth
- Durability

TBD: Do we want defaults?

## Reconfigurability of topics the ROS 2 core creates

TBD: discuss reconfigurability of topics packages in the ROS 2 core creates here, e.g.: clock, rosout, tf, tf_static, etc.

## Further enhancements

### Reusing profiles

The above proposal doesn't include a mechanism to reuse the same qos profile in the parameter files.
We could, for example, leverage yaml anchors to allow this:

```yaml
/my/ns/node_name:
  ros__parameters:
    qos_profiles:
      publisher: &profileA
        'my/fully/qualified/topic/name/here': 
          reliability: reliable
          history_depth: 1
          history: keep_last
/my/ns/node_name:
  ros__parameters:
    qos_profiles:
      subscription:
        'my/fully/qualified/topic/name/here': 
          <<: *profileA,
          history_depth: 100  # override the history depth
```

### Extending the ROS qos profile with a rmw vendor specific payload

TBD

## QoS resolution order

- The QoS provided by the user in the publisher/subscription constructor is used as a default.
- Those defaults are overridden with the values provided in parameters, if the user allowed this kind of reconfigurability.
- If the policy was set to `RMW_QOS_*_POLICY_DEFAULT`, the qos resolution mechanism provided by the rmw vendor will be applied (e.g. DDS XML profile files). If not, the previous policy value is the final one.
